## `SegOptim` segmentation

### input data

in addition to the training data, `SegOptim` requires two additional data sources as input which Goncalves et al. (2019) describe: 

1. *segmentation features*: encompassed less dimensions (in comparison to the classification feature space) to allow fast processing needed to run segmentation. For example, the Red (R), Green (G) and Blue (B) bands were employed
2. *classification features* were many: 
    + spectral bands (reflectance values); 
    + alternative colour spaces (other than RGB but with better separability between components; e.g., XYZ, YUV); 
    + multiple combinations of band ratios in the form: where and are any two different spectral bands; 
    + vegetation and/or water indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI, NDWI); 
    + multiple combinations of Normalized Difference Indices (NDI); 
    + texture operators such as Haralick (Haralick, 1979) (HL; e.g., energy, entropy, correlation, inertia), Local Statistics (LS; e.g., mean, variance)
    
all data needs to be saved to the disk for reading by the `SegOptim` package functions

```{r}
tempdir_temp <- tempdir()
fpath_train <- file.path(tempdir_temp, "train.tif")
fpath_seg <- file.path(tempdir_temp, "seg.tif")
fpath_class <- file.path(tempdir_temp, "class.tif")
# write
terra::writeRaster(class_rast_training, filename = fpath_train, overwrite = T)
terra::writeRaster(
  pred_rast %>% terra::subset(c("red","green","blue"))
  , filename = fpath_seg
  , overwrite = T
)
terra::writeRaster(
  pred_rast # includes indicies and textural as well as RGB
  , filename = fpath_class
  , overwrite = T
)
```

for this example we'll use the Large Scale Mean Shift segmentation algorithm ([Michel et al. 2014](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2475881846105669180&hl=en&as_sdt=0,6)) which is implemented using the [Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download/) software which provides [documentation for the algorithm](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/Applications/app_LargeScaleMeanShift.html?highlight=spectral%20range) and a [cookbook here](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/recipes/improc.html#segmentation)
